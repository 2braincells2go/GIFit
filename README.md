##Installing

Since GIFit hasn't yet been released to the Chrome Web Store, you'll need to install it manually. Here are some quick and easy steps for success:

1. Download this repository. If you don't want to clone it, there's a handy ZIP link to the right.
2. Head over to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and enable "developer mode" (it should be a small checkbox at the top right).
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the `GIFit/dist` folder.
4. Navigate to [YouTube](http://youtube.com). You should now see a "GIFit!" button in video toolbars.
